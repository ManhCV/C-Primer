Exercise 4.19: Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a
vector<int>, and that ival is an int, explain the behavior of each of
these expressions. Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might
each be corrected?
(a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++
(b) ival++ && ival
(c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++
Evaluate if ptr is different from NULL and if the initial value of ptr is nonzero and then increment ptr

(b) ival++ && ival
Increment ival the return a copy of ival(the value of ival is not unchanged)
Expression is alway true if ival is nonzero and vice versa.

(c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]
Increment ival the return a copy of ival(the value of ival is not unchanged)
Expression is alway true
