Exercise 4.9: Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:

const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical AND (&&) returns bool type.
cp is a const pointer of char array. cp has value that is address if first char array and 
*cp has value that is ASCII code of character "H". So expression "if (cp && *cp)" returns true.
