Exercise 4.15: The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you
correct it?

double dval; int ival; int *pi;
dval = ival = pi = 0;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can not assign pi to ival because can not assign pointer of int type to int

Correct:
double dval; int ival; int pi;
dval = ival = pi = 0;
