Exercise 4.18: What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that
prints the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?

auto pbeg = v.begin();
// print elements up to the first negative value
while (pbeg != v.end() && *pbeg >= 0)
cout << *pbeg++ << endl; // print the current value and advance pbeg

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
if you prefix increment, the while loop becomes:
auto pbeg = v.begin();
// print elements up to the first negative value
while (pbeg != v.end() && *pbeg >= 0)
cout << *++pbeg << endl; // print the current value and advance pbeg

Because the precedence of prefix increment is higher than dereference, so *++pbeg equivalant to *(++pbeg).
The subexpression ++pbeg increments pbeg and yields the changed object as its result.
Thus, the statement prints the element to which pbeg newly pointed (not originaly pbeg pointed) and increments pbeg.
