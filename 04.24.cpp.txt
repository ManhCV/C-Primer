Exercise 4.24: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass,
and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right
associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator
were left associative.

finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass
: (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

if the operator were left associative.
The result will have no changes.
if the grade less than 60 finalgrade is fail
if 60<= grade <=90 finalgrade is pass 
if grade > 90 finalgrade is high pass
